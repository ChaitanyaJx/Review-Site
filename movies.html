    <h2>Review </h2>
    <p>
        Pulp Fiction is a masterpiece, a real titan, a classic, it really is a unique film and it has that classic Quentin Tarantino theme. The movie was great when it came out in the 90's and even now it's amazing, the movie has some of the best lines I've heard in a movie, so real, simple, unique ... it's what you expect it to be. hear in real life. The story is divided into three parts, it jumps from one story to another, they are not exactly in chronological order, but they manage to make a connection between the characters, you can connect with the characters very easily. The cast was incredible John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Bruce Willis, Tim Roth, Uma Thurman, Harvey Keitel, Amanda Plummer, Maria de Medeiros, Ving Rhames, Rosanna Arquette, Eric Stoltz, Christopher Walken, Quentin Tarantino, a bestial cast, some gorgeous actors, each of them had stunning lines and amazing performance The film is good, it makes me want more, Tarantino knows how to make a film and I will say that he is one of the best film directors. The movie kept me captivated until the end, I laughed, I was shocked and I had a great time. However, they are very curious what is in the briefcase, some say that there were dynamite, others with religion, gold or others.

            <h2>Review</h2>
            <p>
                "The Wolf of Wall Street" is a tour de force of excess and indulgence, masterfully directed by Martin Scorsese and propelled by Leonardo DiCaprio's electrifying performance. The film catapults viewers into the hedonistic world of Jordan Belfort, a charismatic but morally bankrupt stockbroker.

                Leonardo DiCaprio's portrayal of Belfort is nothing short of mesmerizing, capturing the character's charm, ruthlessness, and eventual downfall. The narrative, penned by Terence Winter, unfolds with unrelenting energy, providing a scathing critique of greed and corporate corruption.

                Scorsese's direction infuses the film with dynamic visuals, rapid pacing, and a mix of humor and intensity. The supporting cast, including Jonah Hill and Margot Robbie, delivers standout performances that contribute to the film's magnetic allure.

                "The Wolf of Wall Street" is unapologetically audacious, taking the audience on a rollercoaster of emotions and moral ambiguity. It doesn't just depict excess; it immerses viewers in a world where the pursuit of wealth knows no bounds. A cinematic spectacle that lingers in the mind, the film is a testament to Scorsese's storytelling prowess and DiCaprio's acting prowess.
